python manage.py createsuperuser


7. Deployment
Heroku: Follow Heroku's Django deployment guide.
AWS EC2: Consider EC2 with an Nginx reverse proxy for scalability.
Docker: Containerize the app for environment-agnostic deployments.

8. Testing
Unit Tests: python manage.py test
Load Testing: Use Apache JMeter or Artillery for load testing.

9. Performance Tuning
